The warehouse takes care to keep the entire data together with all essential consistency, isolation, integrity and aggregation of data simultaneously. This warehouse is used to generate reports to present the answer to various business monitoring and directing questions. The main features provided by the solution are Role-based access to the company’s data, Localization according to viewer’s locale, full currency conversion support and wide range of components (charts, tables, matrices etc) to present information according to business needs. Some reports provide the “Shallow-n-Wide” to “Deep-n-Narrow” view of information by enabling users to view data from a higher global level and drilling down to lower elementary level. That is, the reports support Dashboards to show data from summary to detail level using drilldown feature. Another component of project, the Ad-hoc Reporting allows the user to create there own report on fly with just few mouse clicks and drag-drop operation. Managers can easily extract the information they want without having much technical knowledge or understanding of underlying technologies. The complex and well connected schema of data warehouse can be modified to include the newly user defined tables and fields according to changes made in database of individual country’s data base. A fully functional tool with user friendly UI has been provided to update the complex structure of data warehouse.

Company Name: HCL Technologies, Gurgaon (05/1997 – 08/2004)

Project Title	:	Hard Copy Conversion System (Client – LexisNexis)
Scope of the Project	:	LexisNexis gathers information on various topics. Some of these documents are received in form of hard copies, which is to be converted to either XML or VISF (Proprietary to LexisNexis) format. These hard copies are to be scanned, OCRed, converted to XML / VISF, corrected for error (if any), archived in CD using jukebox and finally updated to database on mainframe. All the hardcopy documents, which are to be scanned, using Kodak Scanner, have a cover page, which has information about the SID (Unique Document Identifier) and type of the document. This SID is read using bar code reader. 
 
The complete system can broadly be divided in four flows – 
 
Library Service (LS) – Library Services workflow allows users to scan hard-copy source documents and archive the images for the retrieval process.
In House Conversion (IHC) – In House Conversion application converts the hard copy documents to the searchable online documents. It scans the hard copy documents and saves them as images. OCR application is used to extract the contents from the images. This content is then converted to XML/VISF format in house before getting updated in the main frame.
Out Source Conversion (OSC) - OSC flow tracks document from the time document scanned, shipped to offshore vendors for conversion, time documents come back from vendor and sent to update.  
Optical Scanner and Character Error Recognition (OSCER) – OSCER flow is for quality checking of the documents. It allows users to scan and OCR hard-copy source, edit segments contained within the hard-copy source in preparation for comparison between scanned & OCRed version of the document.
 
The existing system was developed on Unix box and different tasks were managed by cron jobs. GUIs were developed using motif and it had third party dependency for running binaries. 
 
To make the system more user friendly, efficient, stable and to remove the third party dependency, it is being redesigned to be developed using Java, GUI using swing, Database will be implemented using Oracle and workflow is to be managed by Tibco InConcert Workflow Management System.
